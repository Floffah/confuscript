"Hey man why is this called confuscript?"

ok ill explain

the reasoning behind the name is as follows:
 - It is confused as to what it compiles to. It can be live interpreted (but wont recognise file changes), it can be compiled to nodejs, java, or native executables via Go
 - The syntax is a combination of the java structure, with typescript's types, and csharp's naming
