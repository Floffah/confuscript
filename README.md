# Q: Why is this archived?
This repository has been archived to make way for the new confuscript structure which you will see soon! See progress [here](https://github.com/confuscript/confuscript). A lot of code from here has and will be migrated over to there.

# confuscript
A confused programming language for writing confused things.

You can see the grammar rules [here](https://floffah.github.io/confuscript/) before i make proper docs and guides

"Hey man why is this called confuscript?"

ok ill explain

the reasoning behind the name is as follows:
 - It is confused as to what it compiles to. It can be live interpreted (but wont recognise file changes), it can be compiled to nodejs, java, or native executables via Go
 - The syntax is a combination of the java structure, with typescript's types, and csharp's naming
